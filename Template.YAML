  ep1: "خواندن را از اینجا شروع کنید. اگر فقط یک چیز است که از این کمیک حذف می کنید، بگذارید این یکی باشد"
  ep2: "برای درک نحوه عملکرد HTTPS، باید بدانید رمزگذاری کلید متقارن و نامتقارن چگونه کار می کند. به نظر کلمات بزرگی می رسد، اما واقعاً اینطور نیست"
  ep3: "وقتی به یک سایت امن HTTP مرور می‌کنید، مرورگر شما و سروری که در آن متصل می‌شود، یک دست دادن مخفی دارند. ما این را تجزیه می کنیم و آن را به دنیای واقعی می آوریم تا بتوانید با دست دادن مخفیانه به دوستان خود سلام کنید"
  ep4: "به راحتی می توان HTTPS، SSL و TLS را اشتباه گرفت. ما اغلب از این اصطلاحات به جای هم استفاده می کنیم. بیایید در مورد هر یک از آنها با کمی تاریخچه صحبت کنیم"
  ep5: "چه کار می کنند؟ چه نیازی به آنها داریم؟ چگونه گواهینامه ها را تایید می کنند؟ در این فصل آخر کمیک باید به سوالات زیادی پاسخ داد!"

# Episodes
ep1:
  1: "چرا به HTTPS نیاز داریم؟"
  2: "ما به 3 دلیل به HTTPS نیاز داریم"
  3: "حریم خصوصی، یکپارچگی و هویت"
  4: "بیایید ابتدا در مورد حریم خصوصی صحبت کنیم"
  5: "من از دوستانم به عنوان مثال استفاده می کنم"
  6: "no text"
  7: "من در حال ارسال پیام به Browserbird هستم"
  8: "وای نه! پیام رمزگذاری نشده!"
  9: "خرچنگ در حال گوش دادن به ارتباط است و پیام را ضبط می کند"
  10: "به طور بالقوه استفاده از آن برای شر"
  11: "حریم خصوصی به این معنی است که هیچ کس نمی تواند پیام های شما را شنود کند"
  12: "خرچنگ بد. بد"
  13: "وقتی به وب سایتی بدون HTTPS مراجعه می کنید، ممکن است رمز عبور شما را شنود کنم"
  14: "قفل سبز روی نوار URL مرورگر به شما می گوید که هیچ خرچنگی روی شانه شما مراقب نیست"
  15: "دلیل شماره 2: یکپارچگی"
  16: "مثال در راه است!"
  17: "من در حال ارسال پیام دیگری به Browserbird بدون رمزگذاری هستم"
  18: "اما قبل از اینکه به Browserbird برسد، پیام را قطع می کنم"
  19: "من پیام را به روز می کنم تا چیزهای بدی در مورد Browserbird بگویم و آن را برای او ارسال می کنم"
  20: "چرا كامپيوتر چنين چيزهايي را در مورد من مي‌گويد؟"
  21: "no text"
  22: "این اغلب به عنوان حمله مرد میانی نامیده می شود"
  23: "و حملات خرچنگ میانی بدترین هستند"
  24: "خرچنگ بد. بد"
  25: "یکپارچگی به این معنی است که پیام در مسیر رسیدن به مقصد دستکاری نشود"
  26: "من مطمئن می شوم که ارتباط شما دستکاری نشده است"
  27: "دلیل شماره 3: هویت"
  28: "زمان مثال!"
  29: "هویت به این معنی است که من می توانم بررسی کنم که این پیام از طرف Compugter آمده است"
  30: "امضای دیجیتالی متصل به پیام می تواند فرستنده را شناسایی کند"
  31: "امضای دیجیتال متن پایانی ایمیل شما نیست. هر کسی می تواند آن را کپی کند ;)"
  32: "و هنگامی که در حال مرور وب هستید، هویت به این معنی است که سایتی که بازدید می کنید واقعاً همان سایتی است که شما فکر می کنید"
  33: "HTTPS، از طریق گواهی‌های SSL، تضمین می‌کند که دقیقاً با گیرنده‌ای که انتظار دارید متصل هستید"
  34: "This SSL certificate is valid and has been issued by a legitimate Certificate Authority. You are good to go."
  35: "به زودی در مورد گواهینامه های SSL و مقامات گواهی بیشتر صحبت خواهیم کرد، پس با ما همراه باشید"
  36: "به طور خلاصه، حریم خصوصی، یکپارچگی و هویت دلایل اصلی اهمیت HTTPS هستند"
  next: "بعدی در HowHTTPS.works"
  next_teaser: "اکنون که دلیل آن را می دانیم، گام بعدی درک رمزگذاری متقارن و نامتقارن است. کلمات بزرگ، اما مفاهیم آسان"

ep2:
  1: "کلیدها"
  2: "HTTPS needs a way to provide privacy, integrity, and identification on the web."
  3: "And that mechanism is called 'encryption'."
  4-1: "Let's talk about the two types of encryption algorithms."
  4-2: "Now, where did I put those keys?"
  5-1: "Finally!"
  5-2: "Let's start with the symmetric key algorithm."
  6: "In this scenario, there is only one key to encrypt and decrypt a message."
  7: "Before sending a message to BrowserBird, I encrypt the message with a key."
  8: "You can think of the encryption process like putting the message in a box and locking the box with a key."
  9: "Only the person that has a copy of the key can open the box and read the message."
  10: "This guarantees that the box cannot be opened until it reaches the person with the right key."
  11: "When Browserbird gets the box, they use their key to open it and read the message."
  12: "It's important that the key is kept private. You should not share the key in plain text, or send it with the box. Or keep it in your pocket."
  13: "Remember, anyone with the key can open the box."
  14-1: "Using the box is a nice visual to understand encryption, but it's really oversimplifying it."
  14-2: "Let's fix that!"
  15: "In reality, anyone looking at the message without the key only sees nonsense text."
  16: "This text was generated by an encryption algorithm."
  17: "Which is a fancy way to say that the text was scrambled through a series of steps."
  18: "It was transformed and spread out multiple times. Each time obfuscating the message further."
  19: "To decrypt a message, we just need to apply the same steps, but in reverse order."
  20: "The encryption key is mixed in with the message, so even if you know the encryption algorithm, without the key, the message is still nonsense."
  21: "Here is what a key might look like."
  22: "One main issue with symmetric keys is that they are hard to share."
  23: "You have to be super careful with how you distribute the key."
  24: "This brings us to asymmetric keys."
  25: "The main difference with symmetric keys, is that you have 2 keys."
  26: "One key is public, the other one is private. They are paired and work together."
  27-1: "Share your public key with anyone. Send it in plain text, make stickers, tattoos. Anything you want! It's public!"
  27-2: "I like tattoos."
  28: "Compugter is sending their public key to BrowserBird."
  29: "And now I am sending a message back to them encrypting it with their public key."
  30: "In other words, BrowserBird puts the message in a box and locks it with Compugter's public key."
  31: "I can now use my private key to read the message."
  32: "That's the main idea. Only the private key can open a box locked with the public key pair."
  33: "I use Browserbird public key to send them another message."
  34: "This is great not only for privacy, but also for identification since we know for sure that only the owner of the 2 keys can open the message."
  35: "Next, we'll be looking at how symmetric and asymmetric keys play a role when we connect to a site with SSL."
  next: "Next on HowHTTPS.works..."
  next_teaser: "Hurray for encryption! What's next? Learn the secret handshake between your browser and the internet that makes your information safe and secured."

ep3:
  1: "The Handshake"
  2: "When you started reading this comic, your browser displayed a green lock on the address bar."
  3: "How did that happen?"
  4: "Your browser communicated with our server, where this comic is hosted, and they both established a secure connection to transmit messages."
  5: "But first, they needed to agree on how to communicate securely."
  6: "If the negotiation is not successful, your browser lets you know by showing an error or warning."
  7: "If an agreement is reached, your browser is happy to display a green padlock on the address bar."
  8: "This process, the negotiation between a browser and a server, is called 'the handshake'."
  9: "It happens very fast. We are going to show you how it works."
  10: "Browserbird will be your browser."
  11: "Compugter will be our server."
  12: "Take it away guys!"
  13: "Ready? Here is what the 'handshake' in slow-motion looks like."
  14: "Left clap"
  15: "Right clap"
  16: "Vertical shaka"
  17: "Shaka horizontal rotation"
  18: "Tickles"
  19: "Done!"
  20: "Let's do it again, but faster."
  21: "Left clap - Right clap - Shaka - Shaka rotation - Tickles."
  22: "A-G-A-I-N !"
  23: "Stop!"
  24: "Let's break it down. Step by step."
  25: "Step One: Left clap. AKA Client Hello."
  26: "I send a list of SSL/TLS versions and encryption algorithms that I can work with to Compugter."
  27: "A fancy word for the encryption algorithm list is 'cipher suite'."
  28: "So you can sound like a pro at the dinner table."
  29: "The SSL and TLS protocols have evolved over time, we'll talk more about that soonish."
  30: "And then I wait for an answer from Compugter."
  31: "Step two: Right clap. AKA Server Hello."
  32: "I choose the best SSL/TLS version and encryption algorithm among the ones browserbird sent me, and based on my preferences."
  33: "I reply with my certificate, which includes my public key, so they can verify who I am."
  34: "Step three: Vertical shaka. AKA Client Key Exchange."
  35: "I check Compugter's certificate to make sure they are legit."
  36: "I generate a 'pre-master key' so we can both use it later when we generate a unique key."
  37: "I encrypt that pre-master key with Compugter's public key and then send it to him."
  38: "Step four: Shaka horizontal rotation. AKA Change Cipher spec."
  39: "I use my private key to decrypt the pre-master key."
  40: "So far all the communication between them has been in the open. They haven't secured any messages."
  41: "They used asymmetric keys (public and private keys) to encrypt the pre-master key so nobody could spy on it."
  42: "Now they both generate the same 'shared secret' that they are going to use as a symmetric key."
  43: "And browserbird sends a test."
  44: "Compugter responds."
  45: "Step five: Tickles. AKA Everything is now secured."
  46: "Now all data going back and forth between Browserbird and Compugter is now secured for the rest of the session."
  47: "Passwords, credit card details, everything."
  48: "Simple, right?"
  49: "Next time you connect to a website securely via HTTPS, give your browser the shaka because you know their secret handshake."
  next: "Next on HowHTTPS.works..."
  next_teaser: "HTTPS, SSL, TLS, oh my! I just had an acronym soup for lunch. What do they mean? Are they the same thing?"

ep4:
  1: "The differences between HTTPS, SSL, and TLS"
  2: "It's easy to confuse these terms and use them interchangeably."
  3: "Let's look into each one and see how they differ."
  4: "What's HTTPS?"
  5: "HTTPS is the secured version of HTTP: HyperText Transfer Protocol."
  6: "HTTP is the protocol used by your browser and web servers to communicate and exchange information."
  7: "When that exchange of data is encrypted with SSL/TLS, then we call it HTTPS. The 'S' stands for Secure."
  8: "OMG! Wait! Did I say SSL/TLS! Why?"
  9: "Because it's the precise way to talk about SSL and TLS."
  10: "SSL stands for 'Secure Sockets Layer'. A protocol created by Netscape."
  11: "SSL is a dinosaur by Internet standards. The first version was never released and version 2 launched with the browser Netscape 1.1 in 1995."
  12: "Later that year Netscape released version 3 because version 2 had some major security problems."
  13: "We were all happy cats until 1999. Browser wars between Netscape and Microsoft, the need for standards, and Britney Spears - '...Baby One More Time' changed the world as we know it. Fur-ever."
  14: "Oops, I did it again."
  15: "Netscape gave control of SSL protocol to the IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force."
  16: "Before 1999 ended, IETF released TLS version 1.0 (Which was really SSL 3.1)."
  17: "SSL was renamed to TLS: Transport Layer Security. Creating confusion and chaos still to this day."
  18: "Thanks 1999."
  19: "TLS 1.0 took off and version 1.1 was released in 2006."
  20: "A couple of years later, in 2008, TLS 1.2 was released to address a few flaws and exploits."
  21: "However, it's not until 2013 that browsers start to catch up and add support for TLS 1.2."
  22: "To add to the confusion, SSL 3.0 was officially deprecated in 2015."
  23-1: "TLS 1.3 was approved in march 2018 and your browser might already support it."
  23-2: "Click here to check the current TLS version for your browser."
  23-3: "But come back to finish the story."
  24: "TLS 1.3 brings great security improvements and removes old weaker features."
  25: "No worries if your browser doesn't support it yet. TLS 1.2 is still the recommended version if you are reading this in Spring/Summer 2020."
  26: "Let's recap."
  27: "HTTPS is just the HTTP protocol but with data encryption using SSL/TLS."
  28: "SSL is the original and now deprecated protocol created at Netscape in the mid 90s."
  29: "TLS is the new protocol for secured encryption on the web maintained by IETF."
  30: "And now you know the hiss-tory."
  next: "Next on HowHTTPS.works..."
  next_teaser: "Certificates and Certificate authorities: What Do They Know? Do They Know Things?? Let's Find Out!"

ep5:
  1: "Certificate Authorities"
  2: "A certificate authority (CA) is a third-party organization with 3 main objectives:"
  3: "1. Issuing certificates."
  4: "2. Confirming the identity of the certificate owner."
  5: "3. Providing proof that the certificate is valid."
  6: "You might have heard of Symantec, Comodo, or Let's Encrypt, among others."
  7: "Becoming a CA is an intense task of security requirements and audits."
  8: "You need to be trusted to be accepted into a root store."
  9: "A root store is basically a database of trusted CAs."
  10: "Apple, Windows, and Mozilla run their own root stores that they pre-install in your computer or device."
  11: "Which certificate should you buy? You have basically 3 flavors."
  12: "Domain validated. The certificate just verifies the domain name, and nothing else. You probably need this one."
  13: "Organization validated. The certificate requires the validation and manual verification of the organization behind the certificate."
  14: "Extended validation. The certificate requires an exhaustive verification of the business."
  15: "All valid certificates result in the browser displaying a secure badge in the browser bar. EV certificates generally display the company name as well."
  16: "But how do certificates get validated?"
  17: "When a CA issues a certificate, they sign the certificate with their root certificate pre-installed in the root store."
  18: "Most of the time it's an intermediate certificate signed with a root certificate."
  19: "If a cat-astrophy would occur and the root certificate is compromised, it's easier to revoke the intermediate certificates, since the root certificates are installed on each device."
  20: "Let's walk through how a certificate is validated. The process is based on a 'chain of trust'."
  21: "Your browser connects to a site via HTTPS and downloads the certificate."
  22: "The certificate is not a root certificate."
  23: "Your browser downloads the certificate that was used to sign the certificate on the site."
  24: "But this certificate is still not the root certificate."
  25: "Your browser once more looks up the certificate that signed the intermediate certificate."
  26: "It's the root certificate! Yay!"
  27: "The entire certificate chain is trusted, and thus the site certificate is trusted as well."
  28: "In the event that the last certificate is not a root certificate, and there are no more certificates to download, the chain is untrusted."
  29: "But why use a certificate authority when you can self-sign your certificates?"
  30: "A self-signed certificate provides the same level of encryption as one generated by an authority."
  31: "No crabs can spy on your data."
  32: "And there is no charge to self-sign your certificates!"
  33: "Yes, but almost every browser checks that the certificate is issued by a trusted authority."
  34: "As such visitors are warned that the certificate cannot be trusted."
  35: "Self-signed certificates can be useful for testing, and intranets, but you should avoid using them on public sites."
  36: "Self-signed certificates can be forged. Basically, they say 'Trust me, it's me, I promise!'."
  37: "A trusted certificate says: 'Trust me, an authority verified me'."
  38: "Talking about trust. Thank you for trusting us through this story."
  39: "Unfortunately, it is coming to an end."
  40: "We hope you enjoyed this comic!"
  41: "See you soon!"
  end-title: "Hey, you did it!"
  end-p1: "You finished the comic! Thanks from the bottom of of our cat paws for spending some of your day reading about HTTPS."
  end-p2: "We propose three activities to distract you from the fact that there is not another episode to read."
  option-1: "Take the quiz"
  option-1-p: "To make it up to you, you can test your brand hot knowledge of HTTPS in a quiz. Yes, that's right. We even send you a certificate of completion if you score high enough."
  option-2: "Vent on social networks"
  option-2-p: "The human thing to do. If you want to put more pressure on us to make more comics, here are a few examples to get us to the edge of our seats."
  option-3: "Visit DNSimple"
  option-3-p: "If you enjoyed the comic, and need an SSL certificate to secure your site, or a rock solid and easy-to-use DNS (not our words), or a brand new fancy domain, have a look at us."
